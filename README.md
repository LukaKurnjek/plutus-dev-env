# Instructions for setting up a Plutus development enviroment 

This repository tries to maintain up-to-date instructions for how to setup a Plutus development environment. There are three possibilities how to setup the environment: 
* [Using Nix](https://github.com/LukaKurnjek/plutus-dev-env/blob/main/instructions/using-nix.md) that provides a shell which contains all dependencies for building Plutus projects.
* [Using a docker image](https://github.com/LukaKurnjek/plutus-dev-env/blob/main/instructions/using-docker.md), that can be used standalone or integrated with VSCode. 
* [Using Demeter.run](https://github.com/LukaKurnjek/plutus-dev-env/blob/main/instructions/using-demeter-run.md) platform that provides an up-to-date online development environment. 

Instructions for the above posibilites are provided in the folder *instructions*.
